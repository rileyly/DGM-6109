        <p class="article subtitle"><strong>From Overwhelm to Understanding</strong></p>

        <p class="article content">
            Signing a rental agreement for the first time can feel pretty intimidating. 
            After all, that multi-page document filled with legal jargon is a binding contract--
            one that will govern your living situation for months or even years. 
            Understanding a lease before you sign protects you from unexpected costs, 
            clarifies your rights as a tenant, 
            and helps you avoid situations that could jeopardize your security deposit 
            or even living arrangement.</p>

        <p class="article subtitle"><strong>Lease Term Basics</strong> </p>

        <p class="article content">
           Every lease specifies its duration and the conditions under which it can be terminated. 
           Most residential leases are either fixed-term (typically 12 months) or month-to-month. 
           A fixed-term lease provides stability but usually requires you to pay rent for the entire term 
           even if you need to leave early, unless the lease includes specific break clauses 
           or subletting provisions. 
           Look for language about lease renewal, rent increases, 
           and how much notice you must provide if you don't plan to renew. 
           Many leases automatically convert to month-to-month after the initial term ends, 
           but some require you to sign a new agreement. 
           Understanding these terms helps you plan ahead and avoid being locked 
           into an unfavourable situation. </p>

        <p class="article subtitle"><strong>Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p>

        <p class="article content">
           Your lease will outline both your responsibilities 
           and your landlord's for property maintenance and repairs. 
           Generally, landlords must ensure the property is habitable, 
           including maintenance of major systems like heating and plumbing, 
           and handle structural repairs. Tenants typically handle day-to-day cleanliness, 
           minor maintenance like changing light bulbs, and reporting problems promptly. 
           The lease should explain how to request repairs and what timeline the landlord must follow. 
           Understanding these boundaries prevents disputes—
           you'll know when you're expected to handle something yourself 
           versus when you can legitimately demand that your landlord take action.</p>
