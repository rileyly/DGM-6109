        <h2>Sketch #1 - Bubbleplot Variation</h2>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>I want to examine which factors contribute to the number of photos I take per day.</p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>It appears there is a positive relationship between how many steps I walk and the number of photos I take. </li>
                    <li>I'm also interested in what locations are best for overall photo count. I hypothesize that visiting parks leads to more photos taken.</li>
                    <li>Previously I explored whether amount of daily rain affects how much I walk, or how many photos I take. I hypothesize that <em>any</em> amount of rain negatively affects photo count.  </li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Data Elements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Steps:</strong> Number of steps walked per day, as measured by Apple Watch. </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typical Range: 0-20,000 steps</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Number of photos taken daily, 
                        automatically stored and manually counted in Photos app.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typical Range: 0-100 photos</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Rain: </strong>Did it rain?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Valid Range: Yes/No</li>
                            <li>In my most recent visualization, it did appear that rain had an effect on photos taken, but it seemed to relate less to rain quantity, and more just whether or not it rained at all. 
                            <li>In this sketch, I change the rain variable to simple boolean value, using two shapes of uniform size to differentiate between wet/dry days. I hope this will
                                be clearer and less distracting than the scaled radii I used in the last visualization where the varying circle sizes could 
                                obscure smaller data points.</li> 
                            <li>For interactivity, I would like to toggle rain/no-rain days so I can visualize the contours of both plots separately in the same space. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sample Values: Home, Campus, Shopping, Errand, Park, Other</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Datapoint notes upon hover: </strong>I drew inspiration from the Data to Viz bubble plot example, which adds labels (or in my case, interactivity on hover) to peek into outliers. This just adds 
                    a way to display additional--yet optional--information about <em>why</em> certain points may have unusually high/low step or photo counts. 
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Sketch #2 - "Utility Map"</h2>
            <p>I'd like to be able to flexibly explore and filter my dataset and use it to inform my future photo excursions. </p>
            <p>This sketch uses a heatmap of steps to explore how long of a walk is productive for phototaking (vs. diminishing returns).
                I'd considered using <em>photo</em> count be the heatmap data source, but I think it might be more visually representative of the photowalks goal to see how many photo dots are clustered around a given location.
            </p>
            <p>As a general note with all of these sketches (but especially apparent here), the sketched
                colours look muddier and less distinct than they would in a final D3 visualization. This is just due to the markers interacting
                with my pen's black ink, which takes rather long to dry. So...feel free to exercise a bit of imagination on my heat map scales. :-D </p>
            <p><strong>Use cases:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Continue to add data and track progress at visiting and photographing new locations.</li>
                <li>Visually identify gaps in locations visited/photographed.</li>
                <li>Use historical weather and distance traveled data to plan an achievable photowalk route/goal that is suitable to conditions on the present day.</li>
                <ul>Working with date ranges:
                    <li>Examine where I take photos during different seasons, and may also suggest other areas to explore during different times of year. (e.g. if I'm always on a certain hike in spring, maybe try early fall? etc.)</li>
                    <li>Explore holiday effects: Do I go out or stay in on holidays? Should I try a different option? Do I take a lot of pictures without leaving home due to holiday celebrations?</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>Working with photo gallery:
                    <li>Tag available subjects types by location (e.g. mountain, airplanes, murals, good for macro photography, etc).</li>
                    <li>Use image tags to plan future photowalks. </li>
                    <li>Easily compare location's "photogenicness" with effort needed to travel there.</li>
                    <li>Identify good places to reivisit to take more photos (e.g. under different lighting or weather conditions, too crowded, additional photos needed for a project, etc).</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <ul><strong>Caveat: </strong>This hypothesis is technically a bit lateral (and the implementation ambitious)
                    but since this sketch represents where I'd like the project to lead eventually (i.e. even after the quarter ends), I'm including it. </ul>
                <ul>I want to explore whether this dataset/data collection process can be used to inform an effective Photowalk planning/goal setting tool.</ul>
                <ul>I hypothesize that, given long term, more granular data collection, (and better web/D3 skills lol) I will be able to use this data to build and maintain a personal Photowalk tool. </ul>
            <h3>Data Elements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Steps:</strong> Number of steps walked per day, represented cumulatively as heatmap colour gradations 
                                per geographic photo point. </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typical Range: 0-20,000 steps</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Number of photos taken per location, represented as one point on map given geographic data, with numerical callout to indicate multiple photos taken at a single location point. </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typical Range: 0-10 photos</li>
                            <li>I also want to show total photo count for a time range in the visualization somewhere, but I forgot to draw that.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Date:</strong>Possibility to filter by date or range of dates</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typical range: 26 Sept 2025 - indefinite</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Max distance:</strong>Possibility to filter by furthest distance traveled from home location/icon. 
                        Represented as the exclusion of photo points outside of user's designated range. </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typical range: 0 - 5km</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><strong>Photo gallery: </strong>Displays a photo gallery slideout panel (to the right of the visualization)</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Sketch #3 - Creative...option</h2>
            <p>Sketch 3 offers a high-level calendar view to examine interday step and photo patterns. 
                This sketch was inspired, broadly, by the visualizations on Dear-data.com, which piqued my interest in exploring the data from more of a bird's eye view.</p>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>I would like to explore whether physical fatigue (e.g. from too much walking) or psychological burnout (e.g. desire to take photos satisfied or extinguished after recent excursion(s)).
                    I hypothesize that recent high step or high photos day(s) may have a mild-to-moderately negative effect on subsequent counts. I'm curious whether such an effect could come about
                    solely from going on extensive photowalks, or if it would also relate to high step counts from long/busy days (e.g. commuting to/from campus, band practice, or many errands). 
                </p>
            <h3>Data Elements</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Steps:</strong> Number of steps walked per day, represented as coloured shading in lower half of box. </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typical Range: 0-20,000 steps</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Number of photos taken daily, represented as coloured shading in upper half of box.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typical Range: 0-100 photos</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Rain: </strong>Did it rain? Represented as blue colour shading in Photos box. </li>

                    <li><strong>Transit:</strong>Did I take any form of transit that day? Or only walk? 
                        Represented as yellow shading in lower half of box.</li>

                    <li><strong>Location Type:</strong>I've experimented with encoding the location 
                        categories symbolically across a bar in the box center. 
                        I'm not 100% sold on that element, as it may break up the visual continuity between the boxes/days. 
                        But it might be useful as a minor contexual reference (i.e. schedule).</li>
