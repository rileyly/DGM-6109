        <h1 style="text-align:center">What's the optimal travel method and distance for photo engagement?</h1>
        <p style="text-align:left">Hypothesis: Further isn't necessarily better, but staying too close to home leads to fewer photos overall. </p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Additional factor: Initially I thought walking alone might be the best option, but using transit to travel to walkable locations might open more interesting options. </p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Colours: Comparing number of photos taken at each location type vs distance traveled. Starting to move towards a visualization useful to planning an optimal outing.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">This is the other best scatterplot because you can see all the datapoints clearly. 
            The clusters of data points at different distances reveals the distribution of photo counts per location type. 
            Seeing the gap in data points between 2km (mostly walking around neighbourhood) and 4km (transit to campus) made me realize that I could use transit across short-to-medium distances to access new walkable locations outside my immediate area. 
            This has led me to a new hypothesis I can explore after the rainy season:  Using transit to visit parks and shopping districts 1-2 neighbourhoods (i.e. 2-3km) away will enable to me visit more locations and take more photos in a single day.  </p>
