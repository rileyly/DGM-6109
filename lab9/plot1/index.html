        <h1 style="text-align:center">How many locations should I to visit in a single day for increased photo count?</h1>
        <p style="text-align:left">Hypothesis: I'm guessing more locations leads to higher photo counts overall.  </p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Additional factor: How much it rains might negatively affect how much I walk. </p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Colours: What kinds of locations am I visiting when I go to more than one in a day? I hypothesize that I visit fewer locations overall on school days.  </p>
        <p style="text-align:left">This is one of the best scatterplots because it clearly exposes several trends at once: 
            I take very few photos when at home. I mostly don't go out on rainy days unless I have to, for school or an errand. 
            I'm more likely to visit other types of locations on non-rainy days, and typically take more photos there. 
            As I visit more locations in a single day, I generally take more photos overall. Visiting 3 locations or at least 1 park appears to be the sweet spot.  </p>
