        <p>This HTML file is a framework for an alternative way to test the .js files that you create in the first 6 chapters of the "JavaScript Bootcamp" video series.</p>
        <p>Instead of using Node.js, you can follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a copy of this index.html file in the same directory as the .js file (or project) that you wish to test</li>
            <li>Change the <code>&lt;script src=""&gt;</code> tag in this file to be the same as the file that you wish to test (the same file that the video instructions tell you to run using node)</li>
            <li>Open the project in Visual Studio Code and use "Live Server" (i.e., the "Go Live" button) to launch the project</li>
            <li>Because all of the projects in the first 6 chapters output to the console, you will need to open your browser's JavaScript Console to see the results!</li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>NOTE: This should only be used for testing console-based projects. After Week #1 of this class, most homework assignments will involve creating a web application that will have its own index.html instead of this one!</i></p>
