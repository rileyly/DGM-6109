                <h3>Research Question</h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>This project explores whether taking more walks inspires me to take more photos. </p>
                        <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> As the number of steps I take increases, the number of photos I take increases. </p>
                        <p><strong>Second factor:</strong> Rainy conditions may negatively affect how much I walk and/or how many photos I take. </p>
                        <p><strong>Third factor:</strong> I also hypothesize that I take more photos when visiting new, 
                            unfamiliar places than when I spend time familiar ones (e.g. my own neighbourhood). </p>

                        <p>The bare minimum data I needed to answer my question were: <em>date</em>, <em>steps</em>, and <em>photos</em>.</p>
                        <p>I included weather data because I was curious if outdoor conditions (like rain, snow, extremes of heat and cold) would play a role 
                            in how much I walk. </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>My data covers a <em>daily</em> time scale. However, data not subject to memory decay (e.g. max distance, photo count, boolean variables) 
                            were logged retroactively, on an approximately weekly basis.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Based on my visualization, it does appear that
                            walking more leads to more photos.</p>
                        <p>On rainy days, not only am I less likely to take photos, I'm
                            less likely to leave the house except as required. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I also tend to surpass my average photo count 
                            when visiting locations with which I am less familiar.
